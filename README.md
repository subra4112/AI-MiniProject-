# AI-Driven Snake Game Using Deep Q-Learning
### In an AI-driven snake game using deep Q-learning, the snake's behavior and decision-making are controlled by an artificial intelligence algorithm known as deep Q-learning. Unlike a traditional snake game where the player manually controls the snake, here the snake's actions are determined by the AI agent.

Deep Q-learning is a reinforcement learning technique that uses a neural network (deep neural network) to approximate the Q-values, which represent the expected future rewards for each possible action in a given state. The AI agent learns through trial and error, continuously updating its Q-values based on the rewards received from the game environment.

During gameplay, the AI agent observes the current state of the game (e.g., the positions of the snake's body, the food, and any obstacles) and selects an action based on its learned Q-values. The selected action determines the movement direction of the snake. As the game progresses, the AI agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and uses them to update its Q-values, improving its decision-making capabilities over time.

### The objective of the AI-driven snake game remains the same as in a traditional snake game - to guide the snake to eat food and avoid collisions. However, in this AI-driven version, the snake's movements are autonomously determined by the AI agent using deep Q-learning techniques, allowing the snake to learn and improve its gameplay strategy through experience.
